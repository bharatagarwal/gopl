Hello! I'm here to explain this code as if I were Dave Thomas, the author of the "Programming Ruby" and co-author of "The Pragmatic Programmer". Let's walk through the code step by step.

This program is a simple Go application that fetches the contents of one or more URLs concurrently and prints out the time taken, the number of bytes fetched, and the URL itself. Let's break down the code into sections.

**Imports and package declaration:**

The first line, `package main`, defines the package name as "main", which is the default package for an executable program in Go.

The `import` statement lists the required packages:
- "fmt" for formatting input and output
- "io" for input/output operations
- "net/http" for making HTTP requests
- "os" for interacting with the operating system
- "time" for working with time

**Main function:**

The `main()` function is the entry point of the program. It starts by recording the current time in `start`. Then, it creates a channel `ch` of type `string`. Channels are used to communicate between goroutines in Go.

The program then iterates through the command-line arguments (excluding the program name) using a `for` loop. For each URL provided, it launches a new goroutine to fetch the contents of the URL, passing the URL and the channel as arguments.

After launching the goroutines, the program listens on the channel for messages. It prints out the messages received from the `fetch` function as they arrive. This is done in another loop, with the same number of iterations as the number of URLs.

Finally, the program calculates the elapsed time since the start and prints it out.

**Fetch function:**

The `fetch` function takes a URL and a channel as input. It starts by recording the current time in `start`. Then, it sends an HTTP GET request to the URL using the `http.Get()` function.

If an error occurs during the request, the error message is sent to the channel and the function returns.

If the request is successful, the `fetch` function copies the response body to an `io.Discard` writer using `io.Copy()`. This essentially reads and discards the data, while keeping a count of the number of bytes read (`nbytes`). If there's an error during the read, a formatted error message is sent to the channel and the function returns.

After reading the response body, the program attempts to close the response body with `resp.Body.Close()`. If an error occurs during closing, it is printed out.

Finally, the function calculates the elapsed time since the start, formats a string containing the elapsed time, the number of bytes read, and the URL, and sends this string to the channel.

In summary, this code demonstrates how to perform concurrent HTTP requests using Go's goroutines and channels. It fetches the contents of the provided URLs and prints the time taken, the number of bytes fetched, and the URL for each request.
